        <p>Exploring natural and data sciences with curiosity, care, and kindness.</p>
        <p>I'm endlessly curious – whether I'm building data tools, exploring natural sciences, or just following another Wikipedia rabbit hole. I'm also very social, and rarely spend a day without meeting friends. I care deeply about fairness, inclusiveness, and creating safe, welcoming spaces. Data science is how I turn curiosity into insights that matter.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="dialog-body">
        <p>I began this project after discovering the Sentinel satellite missions and wanting to go beyond surface-level tutorials. Rather than repeating the usual "first remote sensing projects," I looked for something dramatic and meaningful – and landed on the 2021 La Palma volcanic eruption.</p>
        <p>Starting with raw Sentinel imagery, I dove into rasterio and other geospatial tools, experimenting with indices like NDVI, and gradually shaping the project into a structured analysis. A particularly rewarding challenge came when I introduced DEM data: different formats, mismatched resolutions, and alignment issues made integration tricky. Building a reprojection workflow and finally seeing vegetation indices plotted in 3D alongside elevation was a breakthrough moment.</p>
        <p>Beyond clustering vegetation "fingerprints," the toolset also supports mapping lava flows and comparing recovery across impact zones. It's not a formal paper, but a foundation others can build on – and it took me from zero geospatial experience to a working ecological workflow.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="dialog-body">
        <p>I've played Overwatch since its release, and at times competitively, so I naturally became fascinated with the esports scene. During university, I discovered the Overwatch League's dedicated statistics site – only to see it shut down when the league ended. Its replacement, the Overwatch Champions Series (OWCS), lacked anything close to the depth of the original stats lab. As a data enthusiast, I was disappointed, but also inspired: if the community didn't have a proper analytics platform, I could build one.</p>
        <p>I started by scraping community spreadsheets and transforming them into a relational database on AWS. Using R and Shiny, I built dashboards, team and map breakdowns, hero ban and interaction analysis, and predictive modules using random forests, boosted trees, and logistic regression via tidymodels. While it never had the full polish of a professional product, my domain knowledge and stack enabled insights that didn't exist elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The project became surprisingly impactful. Streamers, coaches, and YouTubers used it; I even developed a small reputation in the esports community. At one point, a professional coach reached out for advice on integrating data-driven methods into training. Beyond the technical challenge, this was my first experience of building something others genuinely relied on.</p>

        <button class="icon-btn" data-close>✕ Close</button>
    </div>
    <div class="dialog-body">
        <p>I've long been fascinated by the idea of working at a research institute, contributing to humanity's understanding of the natural world and our impact on it. The Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Germany is a particular inspiration. I was accepted for an internship with their data science support group – even though I couldn't attend due to scheduling, it confirmed that this path is possible and worth preparing for.</p>
        <p>This project is built around NSIDC sea ice and ERA5 reanalysis data. The pipeline defines regions in PostGIS, aggregates climate variables over pan‑Arctic, basin/sea and edge‑band tiers, stores features in Parquet and trains sequence models (LSTMs) with daily, weekly and monthly horizons, alongside baseline persistence/climatology.</p>
        <p>It's an ongoing effort that represents a technical step beyond my earlier projects and a concrete move toward research‑aligned data science. In the future, I aim to create my own architecture ideas such as U-net/LSTM combination.</p>
